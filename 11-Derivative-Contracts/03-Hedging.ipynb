    "In order to enable the SP499 we, at first, need to compute the Market Cap of the SP500 and OXY.<br />\n",
    "The market cap can be computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "**EarningReports.BasicAverageShares.ThreeMonths * EarningReports.BasicEPS.TwelveMonths * ValuationRatios.PERatio**\n",

    "In Quantconnect, you can get access to the SP500 (or at least the most similar version to it) by adding **self.Universe.Index.QC500** as Universe.\n",
    "Additionally, we add **OXY** and **SPY** to our security list\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute the market cap we need to get access to the fundamentals. This can be directly done by: <br />\n",
    "**self.Securities[data.Key].Fundamentals** <br />\n",
    "**Important**: data.Fundamentals does not work!<br />\n",
    "Now we can simply calculate the market cap as defined above and sum those caps for all stocks in the SP500.<br />\n",
    "In order to store the market cap for OXY we need to check if the current share contains the OXY object. This can be done via: <br /> \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if \"OXY\" in str(data.Key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally we only need to compute the fraction between the OXY market cap and the SP500 total market cap and then buy those equities based on the calculated fractions\n",
    "(Note: Because we added OXY as an equity it occurs two times in OnData, one time within the QC500 universe and one time as a single slice. Thus we check whether the fraction is < 1 before buying)"
